'''The code you provided will result in an error because sets in Python cannot contain mutable types like lists. In your case, the set s includes a list [1, 2], which is mutable and cannot be part of a set, since sets require their elements to be hashable and immutable.

If you try to run this code:

python
Copy
s = { 8 , 12 , 7 , "Mona" , [1, 2]}
You'll get a TypeError like:

bash
Copy
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
To fix this, you can replace the list [1, 2] with an immutable type, like a tuple:

python
Copy
s = { 8 , 12 , 7 , "Mona" , (1, 2)}
This will work, because tuples are immutable and hashable, making them valid elements for a set.
