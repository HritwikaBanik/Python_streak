code solution :
✔ Removes next-day trades first.
✔ Removes concurrent trades only after filtering next-day exits.
✔ Avoids unnecessary filtering steps.

Sorts trades by Entry Time before processing.
Iterates through each trade, keeping only those where a trade starts after the previous one has closed.
Removes overlapping (concurrent) trades while preserving the first valid trade.
